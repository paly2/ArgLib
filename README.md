# ArgLib

ArgLib is a little but useful library wich can help to manipulate program arguments.

You can put the full files arglib.c and arglib.h in your program directory, or just pick some functions (note: some functions may call others functions, check that if you pick them).

You can get the documentation with examples in the `doc` directory.
